# CramersRule
CRAMER'S RULE 1st calculate determinant of A reduce matrix recursively until it's inthe form ad-bc 2nd Calculate each determinant of replacing columns with results -stores determinants in vector array 3rd Displays results - dx/dA dy/dA dz/dA Notes can take any number of order returns 0 if determinant of A is 0
